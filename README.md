# Euclaude
Euclaude = Euclid + Claude.  A Haskell program for manipulating a triangle and displaying its special properties based on Euclidean geometry, e.g. the triangle's centroid, or its circumcircle.

# Installing and running
You will need to install Haskell on your system before you can run Euclaude.
When you have Haskell (specifically ghc) installed, open a command line from inside the project file
(in the directory where the .hs files are), and run the following command:
```
%> ghc main
```
Then you can run the newly created main.exe.

When the program is running, you can grab each of the triangle's three corners with your mouse and drag it around,
and see in real-time how the rest of the geometrical features move as the triangle changes shape.

# Switching between demos
If you open the file Demos.hs you will see that mainDemo is assigned a value from the demos below.
You can change this to any other demo found in that file, and then recompile main.exe to interact with that demo.
