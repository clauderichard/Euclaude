1. Instead of animating the triangle,
    start with equilateral triangle and use mouse to drag its corners.
2. Standardize to the following center demos:
	centroid
	orthocenter
	circumcenter
	incenter
	9 point center
   Choose them from a menu in the app. Start with 9 point center by default.
3. Add more standard demos for future improvements.
	Napoleon triangle center, both of them
	Nagel point
	Symmedian point
	etc.
