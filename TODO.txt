1. Fix the viewport code (or add it, it doesn't even exist)
2. Add graphics functionality to show symbols for:
    orthogonality
    length equality
    angle equality
    parallel lines
3. Standardize to the following demos:
	9 point circle
	centroid
	orthocenter
	circumcenter
	incenter
   Choose them from a menu in the app. Start with 9 point circle by default.
4. Add all my favorite demos:
	Napoleon triangle + center, both inner and outer.
	Nagel point
	Symmedian point
	Mittenpunkt
	Euler line
	Fermat point
