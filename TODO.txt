1. Instead of animating the triangle,
    start with equilateral triangle and use mouse to drag its corners.
2. Make more flexible structure so you can define generators outside Haskell code.
    Define it in a string, so Haskell can read the string and make a generator.
3. Make structure to define demos outside Haskell, in files.
4. Make new/open menu, use it to open/save generators and demos.
5. Make a users manual explaining how to make the files.
